Crowdsourced documentation for the Pentek Intellidrive PID10 (Pump Controller) MODBUS interface

The MODBUS interface for the Pentek Intellidrive is not documented in the manual, but by request from Pentek and some trial and error, many registers are known.

The PID10 speaks Modbus RTU natively on the RS-485 two-wire port. 19200 Baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit.

The original trial-and-error document is from Terry Love Forum member G33k_B0y.

Upon request for more information to Pentek, this PDF was provided, which compliments some of what G33k_B0y found, and provides some new information, but is not comprehensive.
